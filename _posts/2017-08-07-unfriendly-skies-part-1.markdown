This is the first in a series of blog posts where we’ll explore a use case and a few different machine learning platforms to see how we might build a model, using platforms that can help predict flight cancellations. In part one, we’ll talk about the use case, how and why we limited the scenario, and about the data we gathered to start the data science / machine learning process.
