#### Can you read fast? Really, really fast?
As you start reading this blog, consider that a person reads an average page of text in about 2 minutes, so it could take you about 10 minutes to read this whole post, more or less. Now imagine reading 10 to 20 pages of a scientific paper. Next imagine reading hundreds, thousands, or even millions of such papers. Not an easy — if even feasible — task for a single person or even for a group of avid readers. And even if a group of people can read many scientific publications in a reasonable time, how would they then combine their acquired knowledge and establish correlations between articles and terms of interest, find common patterns related to a specific subject, and so on?
