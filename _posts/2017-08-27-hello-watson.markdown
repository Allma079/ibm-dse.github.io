As we described in Part 1 of this series, our objective is to help predict the probability of the cancellation of a flight between two of the ten U.S. airports most affected by weather conditions. We use historical flights data and historical weather data to make predictions for upcoming flights.

Over the course of this four-part series, we use different platforms to help us with those predictions. Here in Part 2, we use the IBM SPSS Modeler and APIs from The Weather Company.
