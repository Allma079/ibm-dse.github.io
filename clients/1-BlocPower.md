[BlocPower](http://blocpower.io/){:target='blank'} is using the Internet of Things, machine learning, and structured finance to build a platform that will scale clean energy in American inner cities.

BlocPower's technology and finance platform relies on two powerful data and analytics services - the Harmony platform, which is built on databases within the IBM Watson Data Platform, and IBM Data Science Experience, which enables BlocPower to use machine learning to perform comprehensive energy audits of properties.

With these insights, BlocPower gives building owners critical insights they need to enact energy-saving upgrades that will ultimately lower their utility costs.
