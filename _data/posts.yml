  excerpt: "Data has intrinsic value to the enterprise, but how to quantify these data assets has been a struggle for many organizations and for many enterprises as they establish modern data practices and data organizations. In most organizations, data in and of itself doesn’t have intrinsic value. The data’s value emerges only after we build platforms for data science."

  excerpt: "Data Scientists are compared to Unicorns, a rare and mythical creature with great powers. While one can find folks with machine learning skills, it’s extremely rare to find one who’s also a domain expert with a tremendous understanding of the business. The business landscape is changing fast today. One example is retail, an industry that is seeing tremendous disruption due to the shift from brick-and-mortar to online buying. Machine learning is heavily used in this industry to augment the customer buying experience with individualized just-in-time cross-sell and up-sell offers. Let’s walk through a retail use case. We’ll start by identifying the business problem and then we’ll use data science to find a solution."

  excerpt: "In the connected world of today’s digital economy, apps, IoT devices, vehicles, appliances and servers are generating endless stream of event data. Event data is typically in small size per event but streams in at high speed generating huge volumes over time. The stream of events describes what is happening over time and offers the opportunity to track and analyze things as they happen. With access to complete sets of event data, businesses can derive critical insights from comprehensive analysis on all the data."

  excerpt: "Can you read fast? Really, really fast? As you start reading this blog, consider that a person reads an average page of text in about 2 minutes, so it could take you about 10 minutes to read this whole post, more or less. Now imagine reading 10 to 20 pages of a scientific paper. Next imagine reading hundreds, thousands, or even millions of such papers. Not an easy — if even feasible — task for a single person or even for a group of avid readers. And even if a group of people can read many scientific publications in a reasonable time, how would they then combine their acquired knowledge and establish correlations between articles and terms of interest, find common patterns related to a specific subject, and so on?"

Specifically, we hoped to predict the probability of the cancellation of flights between the ten U.S. airports most affected by weather. We used historical flight data and historical weather data to make predictions for upcoming flights. In Part 2, we started our exploration with IBM SPSS Modeler and APIs from The Weather Company. With this post, we look at IBM’s Data Science Experience (DSX)."

  shortlink: https://ibm.co/IML_Multicloud
  excerpt: "More and more cloud-computing experts are talking about “multicloud”. The term refers to an architecture that spans multiple cloud environments in order to take advantage of different services, different levels of performance, security, or redundancy, or even different cloud vendors. But what sometimes gets lost in these discussions is that multicloud is not always public cloud. In fact, it’s often a combination of private and public clouds. As machine learning (ML) continues to pervade enterprise environments, we need to understand how to make ML practical on multicloud — including those architectures that span the firewall. Let’s look at three possible scenarios."
